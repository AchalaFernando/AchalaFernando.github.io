			Our Institutional Relations (IR) team members are located throughout the United States, and serve as your primary point of contact when working with The College of Global Studies.

			They are skilled professionals who have notable experience in the field of education abroad, both as participants and as on-campus advisors. The team is led by our Director, Strategic Development and is comprised of four Associate Directors and a Manager for Events and Enrollment Management Services. This team of six supports all of the institutions in the US ensuring that they receive the proper support, resources, and expertise.

			<h3>Campus Visits</h3>
			Our Institutional Relations team is available for campus presentations - real or virtual - to your faculty, administrators and staff. They have a deep knowledge of the field of education abroad and can access the full resources of The College to support the needs of you and your colleagues. For newer advisors, the team members can serve as a valuable resource for learning about the field. For seasoned advisors, a campus visit can provide a forum to update you on program developments and to learn more about your goals, process and needs. In collaboration with our program managers and program representatives, our IR team members are happy Purdueto work with you to provide general student support as well as conduct pre-departure orientations for students enrolled in Purdue programs.
