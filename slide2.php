			Are you thinking about studying abroad but have more questions than answers? 
			Like any challenge worth pursuing, there is nothing better than talking to 
			someone who has already been there and done that.

			Purdue Ambassadors are students who have recently studied abroad with Purdue
			 and who are available to talk, text, email, video call or connect with you 
			 social media.

			They are eager to share their experiences, knowledge and tips with you and happy
			 to talk about a range of topics from specific courses they took, to locations,
			  activities, events and support available for health and wellness issues.
			Please browse our contact Directory to choose the ambassador you'd like to email. 
			Their program and topics of interest are listed.
			Please note, the Purdue Alumni Ambassadors are sharing their own views, thoughts
			 and experiences of their time abroad; they are not providing professional 
			 expertise or advice in a formal capacity. If you have a specific health
			  or wellness concern, please contact a healthcare professional.
