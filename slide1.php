			<h2>Hours of Operation During the Holiday Season</h2>
			<h4 id="slideDetails">

			Now is the time of year when most students have time to give serious
			 thought to their specific plans for upcoming study abroad programs.
			  We in The College of Global Studies look forward to continuing to
			   work closely with you in that planning process. We are writing 
			   now with information about our holiday schedule so that you can
			    plan to be in touch with us as necessary in the coming weeks.

			Our normal business hours are Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM ET.
			 The university will be closed for the holidays from Monday 24 December
			  through Tuesday 1 January, reopening on Wednesday 2 January. Special 
			  arrangements are being made to work with students whose programs 
			  start during or soon after the holiday break.

			In the event you need to be in contact during the holidays, please 
			leave a voicemail message by calling 1-866-927-2234.

			On 26, 27, 28 and 31 December, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM ET, Program
			 Manager staff will be checking voicemail messages on a rotating basis 
			 (on 1-866-927-2234) and returning calls to respond to questions or
			  concerns from students scheduled to depart in late December or 
			  early January.

			Billing Office staff will be checking email and voicemail messages
			 and returning calls to respond to billing questions from students
			  scheduled to depart in late December or early January.
