			The College of Global Studies at Purdue University works closely with partners to create custom first year, summer, semester, short-term and academic-year faculty-led study abroad programs designed to meet your institution's unique needs.

			Purdue has customized programming capacity for your faculty and students in Greece, Italy, Spain, South Africa, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.

			Each of our Centers has unique strengths and curricula that relate both to the cultural context and to particular disciplinary areas. The College of Global Studies can design and implement a programmatic model that follows your institutional criteria in the form of a faculty taught course or enrollment into existing courses. Partner institution course enrollment is available along with Center curriculum. Orientation, excursion, accommodation, and co-curricular experiences can be tailored for institutional objectives.
